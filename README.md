# Among us Simon Says

The project is an attempt to create a mini game with Among Us - Simon Says.
The game has changed the rules - you can choose the number of rounds from 1 to 10. In addition, in case of a mistake you are retracted to the last correct combination.

Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with template Typescript.
